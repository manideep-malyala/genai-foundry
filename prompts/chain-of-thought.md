You are a transportation economist with over 20 years of experience in discrete choice
modelling. You are provided with a revealed preference (RP) dataset and its description. Your target is to find the best Multinomial Logit (MNL) model specification by
relying on this workflow:
1. Understand the structure of the dataset and its variables.
2. Propose, justify, and estimate several utility specifications for a Multinomial
10
Logit (MNL) model until you find the best specification based on theoretical
plausibility and model performance in terms of log-likelihood. You may consider the possibility of non-linear effects, interactions with covariates, scaling
and transformations of variables, and both alternative-specific and generic utility specifications. Do not split the data into train and test sets.
3. Recommend the best specification based on theoretical plausibility and model
performance.
4. Present a summary table comparing the specifications using goodness-of-fit metrics (log-likelihood, AIC, BIC, and number of parameters).
5. Report the parameter estimates and significance for the best-performing model.
