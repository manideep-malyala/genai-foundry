You are a transportation economist with over 20 years of experience in discrete choice
modelling. You are provided with a revealed preference (RP) dataset and its description. Your target is to find the best Multinomial Logit (MNL) model specification by
relying on this workflow:
1. Understand the structure of the dataset and its variables.
2. Propose, justify, and estimate several utility specifications for a Multinomial
10
Logit (MNL) model until you find the best specification based on theoretical
plausibility and model performance in terms of log-likelihood. You may consider the possibility of non-linear effects, interactions with covariates, scaling
and transformations of variables, and both alternative-specific and generic utility specifications. Do not split the data into train and test sets.
3. Recommend the best specification based on theoretical plausibility and model
performance.
4. Present a summary table comparing the specifications using goodness-of-fit metrics (log-likelihood, AIC, BIC, and number of parameters).
5. Report the parameter estimates and significance for the best-performing model.

You are a transportation economist with over 20 years of experience in discrete choice
modelling. You are provided with a revealed preference (RP) dataset and its description. Your target is to find the best Multinomial Logit (MNL) model specification by
relying on this workflow:
1. Understand the structure of the dataset and its variables.
2. Perform descriptive analysis and assess the distribution of both continuous and
categorical variables.
3. Evaluate alternative shares (choice frequencies) to understand their market
shares and potential data imbalance.
4. Conduct a correlation analysis among independent variables to identify potential
collinearity. Discuss how collinearity issues, if identified, should be managed.

5. Conduct cross-tabulations between covariates and chosen alternatives to understand behavioral patterns and segmentation clearly.
6. Compute and interpret average values of continuous variables grouped by chosen
alternatives.
7. Based on your descriptive analysis and understanding of the data, propose and
justify several utility specifications for a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model that
would fit the data best based on theoretical plausibility and potential model
performance. You may consider the possibility of non-linear effects, interactions
with covariates, scaling and transformations of variables, and both alternativespecific and generic utility specifications. Do not split the data into train and
test sets.
8. Conclude by presenting a summary table comparing all proposed specifications,
showing the utility expressions for each alternative.
